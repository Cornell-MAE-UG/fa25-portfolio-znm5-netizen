In my ENGRD 2020 course, I worked on a design project where the challenge was to create a rigid bar structure capable of vertically lifting the greatest possible weight using a linear actuator of our choice. The assignment required us to work within strict dimensional and structural constraints, which pushed me to think carefully about material selection, geometry, and load distribution. I approached the problem by modeling different design iterations, analyzing the forces at key points, and optimizing the structure for both strength and efficiency. This project not only reinforced my understanding of mechanics and actuator systems but also gave me hands-on experience in applying engineering principles to balance creativity with real-world limitations.
