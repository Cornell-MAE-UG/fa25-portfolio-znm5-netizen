description: Mechanism Design & Beam Analysis Project

This project focused on designing a lifting mechanism first as a rigid bar and then as a flexible beam. The work included identifying constraints, running a static analysis, and then redesigning the bar once deformation effects were introduced.

Step 1 — Rigid Bar Design

In the first part of the project, the bar was modeled as perfectly rigid. I created a clear problem statement, listed the design constraints, and defined the system’s degrees of freedom.

Using a free-body diagram, I analyzed the forces acting on the bar and used static equilibrium to determine how much load the mechanism could lift. With the actuator force and angles given, the analysis showed that the mechanism could safely lift a little under 284 kN.

A final sketch illustrated the bar, pivot, actuator, and the point where the load is applied.

Step 2 — Flexible Beam Design

Next, the bar was no longer treated as rigid. Instead, it was analyzed as a beam that bends under both its own weight and the transverse component of the actuator force.

Maximum Deflection

I determined how much the beam would bend when loaded. This required making assumptions about the material behavior, treating the beam as elastic, and looking only at the vertical components of the loads. The bending shape and maximum deflection were evaluated using standard beam-deflection relationships.

Designing a Beam That Meets a Deflection Limit

The requirement was that the beam’s vertical deflection must stay below 2% of its length. I compared different possible cross-sections and materials and selected the most mass-efficient option that still stayed under the allowable deflection.

The final design used a lightweight steel cross-section that kept the deflection safely within limits while minimizing total mass.

Final Beam Sketch

A second drawing shows the beam with its supports, weight distribution, and deflected shape to communicate the behavior of the redesigned structure.

Overall Summary

This project demonstrates a complete design process:

Starting with a rigid mechanism

Performing an equilibrium analysis

Transitioning to a flexible beam model

Evaluating deformation

And selecting an efficient structural design that meets performance requirements

The final result is a functional mechanism with an optimized beam that limits deflection while remaining lightweight.
