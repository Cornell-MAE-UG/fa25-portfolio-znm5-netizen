## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Zachary Marasia, and I am someone who thrives at the intersection of engineering, creativity, and community. Civil engineering excites me because it’s about solving real problems and building structures that people rely on every day. At the same time, I’ve built event and music ventures that let me channel my passion for organizing, connecting people, and creating memorable experiences. Whether I’m designing systems in AutoCAD, leading a 1,000 person concert, or responding to calls as a firefighter, I’m motivated by teamwork, leadership, and making an impact. What drives me most is the chance to bring people together through engineering solutions, music, or service and to keep learning by taking on new challenges.
